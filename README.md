# Practice SQL!

During my last semester in college I was brushing up on many topics that I had studied throughout my education. One of those topics was the language SQL and Database Design & Mangement. I had taken a class and a few online courses before, but I was hoping to improve my skills before I graduated and entered a career in ```Data```. There was one problem, though: I didn't have a working environment to practice my SQL.

I wish that I had taken more detailed notes of this process, but I didn't. Nevertheless, I'm going to keep working on this repository to provide the necessary instructions to create a server environment and database within your computer, along with how to query that database/server.

Want to practice your SQL, but don't have a database to work with? Here's a solution.
